= Deck Builder Builder

Summon little guys

I tried the VKGuide, but it has a bunch of issues with running on linux.
A few people tried and failed so I'm just going to keep using, improving, and extending this.

== Build

Need to install Vulkan SDK https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home

Need to install glm, glfw3, meson and all their dependencies.

[bash]
----
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
sudo apt install libglm-dev
sudo apt install meson
----

To actually build and run:

[bash]
----
meson setup builddir
meson compile -C builddir
./builddir/tutorial
----
