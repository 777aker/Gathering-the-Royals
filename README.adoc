= Deck Builder Builder

Summon little guys

The original Vulkan tutorial I found was alright but didn't have everything I wanted.
I tried the VKGuide, but it has a bunch of issues with running on linux.
So, I'm going back to OpenGL for this project. 
This project is 2D anyway so Vulkan is kind of overkill and doesn't make a ton of sense.
But I did learn a lot, and I'll use Vulkan for Bugs in the System because it does make sense there.

== Build

Need to install GLUT and OpenGL https://www.prinmath.com/csci5229/misc/install.html

Need to install glm, glfw3, meson and all their dependencies.

[bash]
----
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
sudo apt install libglm-dev
sudo apt install meson
----

To actually build and run:

[bash]
----
meson setup builddir
meson compile -C builddir
./builddir/tutorial
----
